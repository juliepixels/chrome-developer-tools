## Presenting Tips

f: Full-screen
s: Show slide notes
o: Toggle overview
Esc: Escape from full-screen, or toggle overview

There are pretty extensive slide notes, including demo links, so it's best to run them from the beginning.

There are a lot of self-contained JS examples in that section but nothing should require a page reload. A few other demos are shown using the national Girl Develop It site when noted.
